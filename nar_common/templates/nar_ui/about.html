The <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/about.html">National Water-Quality Assessment Program</a> <b>(NAWQA)</b>
provides an understanding of water-quality conditions; whether conditions are getting better or worse over time; 
and how natural features and human activities affect those conditions. Regional and national assessments are possible 
because of a consistent study design and uniform methods of data collection and analysis. Monitoring data are 
integrated with geographic information on hydrological characteristics, land use, and other landscape features in models
 to extend water-quality understanding to unmonitored areas. Local, State, Tribal, and 
 <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/xrel.pdf">national stakeholders use NAWQA information</a> to design and implement
 strategies for managing, protecting, and monitoring water resources in many different hydrologic and land-use 
 settings across the Nation.

The National Fixed Site Network (NFSN) includes 19 large river coastal sites, 42 large river inland sites, 19 wadeable stream reference sites, 10 wadeable stream urban sites, and 10 wadeable stream agricultural sites. The primary objectives to be addressed by the NSFN are: 1) determine the status and trends in loads and concentrations of contaminants, nutrients, and sediment in the Nationâ€™s large rivers, including loads to selected major estuaries; 2) determine the status and trends in concentrations of contaminants, nutrients, and sediment for case-study wadeable streams in selected land-use and environmental settings; and 3) determine trends in ecological condition in relation to trends in contaminants, nutrients, sediment, and streamflow alteration for case-study wadeable streams in selected land-use and environmental settings.
